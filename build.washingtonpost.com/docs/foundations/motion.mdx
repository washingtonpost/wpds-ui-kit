## Duration

Duration controls how long an animation takes to complete, ranging from ultra-quick micro-interactions to longer, more elaborate transitions.
[View duration tokens.]()

- **Quick Transitions** should use duration tokens between short and xxx-short.
- **Standard Animations** should use short and moderate duration tokens.
- **Complex Animations** should use duration tokens between moderate to xxx-long.

## Transformation

Tranform tokens provide precise control over how elements change positions, scale, or rotate during animations. [View transformation tokens.]()

- **Fade** controls opacity for elements appearing (0% to 100%) or diappearing (100% to 0%).
- **Rotation** changes an element's orientation around its center point by specifying degrees of clockwise or counterclockwise rotation.
- **Scale** changes an element's size by adjusting its dimensions, either uniformly (maintaining proportions by adjusting both X and Y values) or non-uniformly (modifying width and height independently by adjusting X or Y values separately).
- **Slide** moves elements between positions, with elements either entering (slide-in) or exiting (slide-out) the screen.

---

## Easing

Easing functions define how animations progress over time, making movements feel more natural and engaging. [View ease tokens.]()

- **Ease-in** starts slow and accelerates towards the end (like a car gaining speed), making them ideal for elements leaving the screen, fade-out animations, and objects falling due to gravity.
- **Ease-out** starts fast and decelerates towards the end (lie a car coming to a stop), and are ideal for elements entering the screen, pop-up menus and modals, fade-in animations, and objects falling due to gravity.
- **Ease-in-out** provides smooth transitions by starting slowly, accelerating in the middle, and decelerating at the end - making them perfect for state transitions, page changes, and complex UI interations that remain visible on screen.

## Types of Motion

In the dynamic world of news media, The Washington Post's motion design strategy leverages three distinct styles to engage audiences and deliver information effectively across various touch-points in the user experience.

- **Motion in storytelling is dynamic and informative,** bringing narratives to life and enhancing reading experience and comprehension. It can also emphasize immediacy of breaking news reporting.
- **Motion in branding is expressive,** evoking emotion to create memorable experiences and strengthen the connection between the user and The Washington Post. Motion can also help to reinforce our personality and values.
- **Motion for engagement has a functional purpose,** such as guiding users attention, clarifying relationships between elements, streamlining interactions, reducing cognitive load, and maintaining predictable behavior across interfaces.

## Guidance

### Support motion preferences

Enable users with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity to customize their experience by including options to reduce or disable animations.

### Ensure static alternatives are available

Make sure users can access all information and functionality without requiring motion or animation elements.

### Allow time for interaction

Set appropriate animation durations to ensure users can fully comprehend and interact with moving elements before they change or disappear.

### Respect user flow

Animations should enhance rather than hinder the user experience by keeping interactive elements responsive and avoiding unnecessary delays in core functionality.
