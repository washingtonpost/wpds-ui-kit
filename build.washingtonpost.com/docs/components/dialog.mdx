title: Dialog
description: A dialog is an overlay used to display important content or request input from the user. It is layered on top of the primary screen and typically requires the user to take action before continuing. 
Note: Dialogs are designed to be attention-grabbing and prominent to ensure that the user sees and interacts with them, therefore, they should only be used to display critical information. For less critical information and tasks, consider using our drawer component or popover component for actionable UI and our tooltip component for non-actionable UI.

4. Footer (optional)

## Options

### Width

Dialog width can be defined. The default width of the dialog is 500px.

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Height

Dialog height can be defined. The default height of the dialog is 300px.

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Optional footer

The footer is optional when using the dialog. It provides recommended positioning and padding for buttons and links on a dialog for both inline (side-by-side) elements and stacked (vertical) elements.

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Optional close

The dialog close button can be optional. By default, close is true, but it can be set to true or false.

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Custom scrim color

The scrim color can be changed by defining the color using one of our tokens.

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Custom container color

The container color can be changed by defining the color using one our tokens.

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

## Behavior

### Closing

When the close button is rendered, the dialog can be closed by clicking the scrim, the close button, or the cancel button if one is present. 
Note: If the user is required to take action in order to dismiss the dialog, the dialog can be set to open and will remain open even if the scrim is clicked on. The user must then interact with the content in the dialog to close it.
On hover, a circular background color appears behind the close icon.

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Content overflow

Content will overflow, both vertically and horizontally, in the dialog by default. Users can scroll within a dialog. See our guidance on complex and interactive content in dialogs.

Note: If a dialog has vertical overflow, the content in the scrollable area should flow behind the footer. In other words, the footer should be sticky so that the user can always see the action buttons available to them.

```jsx withPreview
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

---

## Guidance

### Content should be accessible

Make sure color contrasts comply with WCAG accessible contrast requirements.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Buttons and links should be placed at the bottom of the container

Buttons should typically be placed at the bottom right of the container or in the center of the container at full-width. If using text links, they should typically be placed at the bottom-center of the dialog along with any buttons. Dialogs should include a maximum of two buttons.

Confirming buttons should be aligned to the end of the screen. See the example below for reference, where the confirming button is on the right and the dismissing button is to its left.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="success"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Avoid overly complex or interactive content in dialogs

Be careful with the level of interactivity and complexity of content inside of a dialog. Avoid using scrollbars in dialogs. 

Make sure that the dialog contains only the essential information and actions. Consider other options, such as a separate page, for content that takes up a lot of space or requires several actions.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="warning"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Dialog should be used with a scrim

Using a scrim with the dialog helps distinguish it from the primary screen in the background. It will help users understand that the dialog is layered above the parent page, shifting the user’s focus appropriately and aligning with best practices for accessibility.

When designing in Figma, pull in the scrim component from the WPDS UI kit to use it in your design.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="success"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Consider screen size when determining the appropriate size for the dialog

Avoid fullscreen dialogs on desktop. On desktop, a dialog should only take up a portion of the screen, with visibility of the primary screen behind it. Ideally, it shouldn’t take up more than 25% of the screen on large screens and desktop. 

On tablets and mobile, dialogs may take up a larger portion of the screen, typically 50% to 100%, as the screen size will be smaller.

Note that these percentages are not exact rules but provide general guidelines to follow.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Fullscreen dialog

```jsx withPreview isGuide="warning"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Ensure that the most critical information goes on the topmost layer

The most critical information should be on the topmost layer, regarding Z-index/layering of the dialog on the page.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="success"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Do not use nested dialogs

Using a nested dialog creates visual complexity. Multiple layers of information and actions can be confusing to users.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="error"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

### Use clear, consistent language in dialogs

Dialog content should be as concise as possible while still effectively communicating its message to users.

When writing headers and buttons, use explicit button text that indicates exactly what will happen and match headers to corresponding buttons. For example, for a dialog labeled “Save your changes,” instead of using buttons labeled “Yes” and “No,” use wording that is more direct and actionable such as “Save” and “Discard.”

```jsx withPreview isGuide="success"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```

## Accessibility

### Keyboard interaction

The dialog component is accessible via keyboard interaction. The “space” key will open and close a dialog. The "tab" key can be used to navigate focus on the next interactive element contained in the dialog. Pressing “shift + tab” can be used to navigate focus on the previous interactive element contained in the dialog. The element currently in focus is denoted by an outline, using the CSS outline property. Pressing the "enter" ("return") key will trigger or commit the action of the focused element. Pressing the “escape” key closes the dialog.

### Include a title and description

An accessible title and optional accessible description should be included to be announced by screen readers when the dialog is opened. Take a look at the code to see the title and description for this example dialog.

```jsx withPreview isGuide="success"
<Dialog.Root open>
  <Dialog.Content>Dialog</Dialog.Content>
</Dialog.Root>
```
