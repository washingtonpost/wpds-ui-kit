- Radio button approved under review
- WPDS Design workshop 2 (Working with our new Figma components)
- WPDS Developer Workshop #1 Again! 🥳 We sold out so we gotta put on another show!
- Image component has been pulled from review. We decided it’s best to leverage existing technologies like Next.js’s Image component (https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization). We will have a foundation doc and resource guide on laying out Images soon.
